Minimum Stock rules and Make to Order have similar consequences but different rules. They should be used depending on your manufacturing and delivery strategies.



### Minimum stock rule

Minimum Stock rules are used to ensure that you always have the minimum amount of a product in stock in order to manufacture your products and/or answer to your customer needs. When the stock level of a product reaches its minimum the system will automatically generate a procurement order with the quantity needed to reach the maximum stock level.
